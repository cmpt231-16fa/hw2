### HW2 (20pts)

1. *(4pts)* Demonstrate **merge sort** on the following array of integers
  (same as in HW1).  Show as much work as you can.
  `[ 35, 50, 44, 61, 17, 75, 23, 9 ]`

2. Consider the recurrence: \` T(n) = T(n/2) + T(n/4) + O(n) \`.
  + a. *(3pts)* **Guess** a solution to the recurrence, showing your work.
  + b. *(3pts)* **Prove** your guess to be correct.

3. *(3pts)* Solve the **recurrence**:
  \` T(n) = 8T(n/2) + 3n^3 + n^2 log n \`

4. *(3pts)* Demonstrate **maximum subarray** on the following input: <br/>
  `[ 6, -5, 4, -1, -2, 4, 0, -3, 2, 3 ]`

5. *(4pts)* Recall that the best-case running time of **insertion sort**
  was &Theta;(n), although the worst-case was \`Theta(n^2)\`.
  Design (e.g., pseudocode) a **randomised** version of insertion sort
  that shuffles the input prior to running the sort.
  Discuss (provide reasoning, but need not be a formal proof) the
  **running time** of your randomised insertion sort.
