### HW2 (20pts)

1. *(4pts)* Demonstrate **merge sort** on the following array of integers
  (same as in HW1).  Show as much work as you can.
  `[ 35, 50, 44, 61, 17, 75, 23, 9 ]`
2. Consider the recurrence: \` T(n) = T(n/2) + T(n/4) + O(n) \`.
  + a. *(3pts)* **Guess** a solution to the recurrence, showing your work.
  + b. *(3pts)* **Prove** your guess to be correct.
3. *(3pts)* Solve the **recurrence**:
  \` T(n) = 8T(n/2) + 3n^3 + n^2 log n \`
4. *(3pts)* Demonstrate **maximum subarray** on the following input:
  `[ 6, -5, 4, -1, -2, 4, 0, -3, 2, 3 ]`
5. *(4pts)* *[analysis of random algos]*
